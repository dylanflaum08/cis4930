<p>
  This assignment introduced the foundational concepts of HTML and CSS. I learned how to create
  web pages from scratch, structure them using tags, and style them with CSS to achieve a
  professional appearance. Additionally, I practiced organizing files and using relative paths
  to link resources effectively.
</p>
<p>
  The process of manually writing HTML and CSS provided valuable insight into how these
  technologies interact and taught me the importance of proper file management for
  web development projects.
