<p>
  This assignment introduced the foundational concepts of HTML and CSS. I learned how to create
  web pages from scratch, structure them using tags, and style them with CSS to achieve a
  professional appearance. Additionally, I practiced organizing files and using relative paths
  to link resources effectively.
</p>
<p>
  The process of manually writing HTML and CSS provided valuable insight into how these
  technologies interact and taught me the importance of proper file management for
  web development projects.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Understand the structure of an HTML document.</li>
  <li>Learn to use CSS for styling and layout.</li>
  <li>Practice linking files and creating relative paths.</li>
  <li>Develop organizational skills for web development projects.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a href="assign2/index.html">Assignment 2</a></h3>
<p>
  This assignment focused on using **decision control structures** in JavaScript and working with **web forms**.
  I learned how to collect user input using various form elements, validate the data using **regular expressions**,
  and dynamically process user input to generate personalized feedback. This enhanced my understanding of the **Document Object Model (DOM)**
  and how JavaScript interacts with HTML elements.
</p>
<p>
  The project also introduced responsive design challenges, where I had to ensure that the form and outputs
  adapted well across different screen sizes. Implementing **if-else conditions** and using event-driven programming
  provided deeper insights into interactive web development.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Learn how to create and validate web forms.</li>
  <li>Understand decision control structures in JavaScript.</li>
  <li>Work with the Document Object Model (DOM) to manipulate HTML dynamically.</li>
  <li>Apply CSS techniques to enhance form usability and responsiveness.</li>
</ul>
