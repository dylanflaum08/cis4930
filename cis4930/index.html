<h3><a href="assign1/index.html">Assignment 1</a></h3>
<p>
  This assignment introduced the foundational concepts of HTML and CSS. I learned how to create
  web pages from scratch, structure them using tags, and style them with CSS to achieve a
  professional appearance. Additionally, I practiced organizing files and using relative paths
  to link resources effectively.
</p>
<p>
  The process of manually writing HTML and CSS provided valuable insight into how these
  technologies interact and taught me the importance of proper file management for
  web development projects.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Understand the structure of an HTML document.</li>
  <li>Learn to use CSS for styling and layout.</li>
  <li>Practice linking files and creating relative paths.</li>
  <li>Develop organizational skills for web development projects.</li>
</ul>

<!-- Assignment 2 Section -->
<h3><a href="assign2/index.html">Assignment 2</a></h3>
<p>
  This assignment focused on using decision control structures in JavaScript and working with web forms.
  I learned how to collect user input using various form elements, validate the data using regular expressions,
  and dynamically process user input to generate personalized feedback. This enhanced my understanding of the Document Object Model (DOM)
  and how JavaScript interacts with HTML elements.
</p>
<p>
  The project also introduced responsive design challenges, where I had to ensure that the form and outputs
  adapted well across different screen sizes. Implementing if-else conditions and using event-driven programming
  provided deeper insights into interactive web development.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Learn how to create and validate web forms.</li>
  <li>Understand decision control structures in JavaScript.</li>
  <li>Work with the Document Object Model (DOM) to manipulate HTML dynamically.</li>
  <li>Apply CSS techniques to enhance form usability and responsiveness.</li>
</ul>

<!-- Assignment 3 Section -->
<h3><a href="assign3/index.html">Assignment 3</a></h3>
<p>
  This assignment focused on repetition control structures and arrays as a data structure.
  I implemented a program that collects a list of numbers from a user and computes several
  different descriptive statistics, such as mean, median, mode, and standard deviation.
</p>
<p>
  I also created a separate JavaScript file, `statistics.js`, which contains a function library
  for performing statistical calculations. The assignment emphasized modularity and code reusability
  by structuring the functions efficiently.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Implemented loops and array manipulations in JavaScript.</li>
  <li>Created reusable functions for statistical calculations.</li>
  <li>Structured a web form to collect and process numerical data.</li>
  <li>Displayed statistical results dynamically using JavaScript.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Additionally, unit testing was conducted with three different datasets to verify the accuracy
  of the statistical calculations. The results of the testing have been documented in an
  <a href="assign3/test_results.html">HTML table</a> for reference.

<!-- Assignment 4 Section -->
<h3><a href="assign4/index.html">Assignment 4</a></h3>
<p>
  This assignment focused on integrating **Bootstrap and jQuery** to enhance the **responsiveness and interactivity**
  of a web form. The original web form from Assignment 2 was **completely redesigned** using Bootstrap's grid system,
  form controls, and buttons to create a clean and responsive layout.
</p>
<p>
  In addition, I used **jQuery** to handle form validation, event handling, and dynamic updates to the page.
  Instead of manually manipulating the DOM using `document.getElementById`, I leveraged jQuery's powerful
  `$()` selector and event-driven programming model. I also added smooth animations using `.fadeIn()`.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Implemented Bootstrap for a responsive layout with grid and form controls.</li>
  <li>Used jQuery for form validation, event handling, and dynamic content updates.</li>
  <li>Created a smoother user experience with animations and error messages.</li>
  <li>Ensured compatibility across different screen sizes and devices.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Additionally, I completed a **Bonus Challenge** where I recreated the form using **W3.CSS** as an alternative
  to Bootstrap and **AngularJS** as an alternative to jQuery. This gave me insight into how different frameworks
  handle styling and interactivity.
</p>
<p>
  The results of this alternative implementation can be found <a href="assign4/bonus/index.html">here</a>.

<!-- Assignment 5 Section -->
<h3><a href="assign5/index.php">Assignment 5</a></h3>
<p>
  This assignment introduced server-side programming with PHP. I created an interactive Pok√©mon-themed quiz
  using <strong>index.php</strong>, and handled user responses using <strong>process.php</strong> which evaluates the answers, provides feedback,
  and stores results in a <strong>CSV file</strong> on the server. Each quiz submission includes the user's name, their responses, and score.
</p>
<p>
  I also built an <strong>admin dashboard</strong> in <strong>admin.php</strong> that summarizes performance data across all users,
  including item difficulty statistics and overall score distribution (average, min, max). This required reading and parsing CSV data
  server-side and displaying it in a clean, tabular format.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Created a server-side PHP quiz with form inputs and question logic.</li>
  <li>Stored quiz results securely using a CSV file on the server.</li>
  <li>Provided item-level feedback and score reporting to the user.</li>
  <li>Summarized performance analytics in an admin-only results page.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  As part of the <strong>Bonus Challenge</strong>, I implemented client-side validation using jQuery to prevent incomplete submissions and
  improve the overall quiz experience. Users receive immediate error messages if any fields are left blank before submission.
